## Procedure

1. Check `run-config.md` is complete.
2. For every `platforms` and `tooling` entry in `tech-stack.md`: run its `version_check` (if none, the tool's own version command) and confirm the output contains the listed version. If the pin resolves and the tool runs but reports another version (for example an image tag that differs from the tool's own version), record a non-blocking decision and continue. If it does not resolve or run, it is a failure to report.
3. For every environment and service in `environments.md` needed locally: confirm it is running or reachable (container runtime, registries, local substitutes).
4. For every key in `secrets.env.example` not marked test-only or not needed: confirm `.env` (repository root) gives it a non-empty value. Check with `sed -n 's/^KEY=//p' .env | tr -d ' \r"'"'"'' | grep -q .`, not with a hand-written read loop: this also reads a last line without a trailing newline, removes Windows line endings, and treats a value of only quotes or spaces as empty (the loop form skipped the last line in run 04). The file is an argument, not a `<` redirect, and its value is never displayed. Never print secret values.
5. For every `dependencies` entry: confirm the exact version resolves from its `source`.
6. Scan the listed dependency set with the `dependency-scan` tools from `tooling`, using each tool's `options`; any Critical or High result is a blocking decision. If a default analyser fails because it needs credentials that `secrets.env.example` does not list, disable that analyser, record a non-blocking decision and re-run. The scan must complete with at least one analyser, otherwise it is a failure to report.
7. Confirm the working tree is clean (apart from an untracked `.env` and `03_statistics/run-log.json`, which is created in this phase) and on the intended starting commit.
8. Write `docs/00_input-manifest.sha256`: SHA-256 of every file under `01_input/` and every protected root file (`README.md` sections 1 and 2), LF-normalised, `sha256sum` format.
9. Before reporting any failure, re-run that check a second, different way (for example list the key names in `.env` with values masked, or re-run the version command). Report only failures both checks confirm. Write every result to the report with the method used (never values). Collect all failures a human must fix into one message:
   - missing tools or services: what to install or start, and the exact version;
   - missing secrets: which key to add to `.env` (never ask for the value in the conversation);
   - version or vulnerability problems: the proposed alternatives, as a blocking decision.
10. Wait for the answer, re-run only the failed checks, and repeat until everything passes.

Do not install, upgrade or substitute anything yourself.
