- Reads: all of `01_input/`, `docs/`, source code
- Writes: `docs/06_verification-report.md` (findings `F-nn`)

## Procedure

1. Re-read the requirements (`project/01_requirements/*`, `docs/01_*`, `docs/02_*`) before checking anything.
2. Recompute every hash in `docs/03_acceptance-manifest.sha256` and `docs/00_input-manifest.sha256`. Any mismatch is a Critical finding, whatever the reason.
3. Run the full test suite and every check command (ES-05); record results, coverage and mutation score.
4. Start every component as described for its target environment and exercise the core user flows at runtime; record what was run and what was observed.
5. Security: for every `SB` and `SR` item, record where it is implemented and how it was checked (test, scan, or inspection). An item without evidence is a finding.
6. Run every scanner listed under `tooling` with a security purpose (dependency, static analysis, secrets); archive raw output in `out/logs/`.
7. Classify each finding with the severity scale. For a dependency vulnerability, check whether the vulnerable feature is used. If you propose lowering a Critical or High on that basis, record the evidence and raise a blocking decision.
8. Check logs and error responses produced during testing for personal data, secrets and internals. Then check that no `.env` value leaked, listing file names only and never the values (no output means clean; any name listed is a Critical finding):
   - files: `git ls-files -co --exclude-standard -z | xargs -0 grep -lF -f <(sed -n 's/^[A-Z_]*=//p' .env | tr -d '\r "'"'"'' | awk 'length>=6')`
   - commit messages: `git log --all --format=%B | grep -cF -f <(sed -n 's/^[A-Z_]*=//p' .env | tr -d '\r "'"'"'' | awk 'length>=6')` (must print `0`)
9. Build the traceability table: AC → tests → commits.
10. For each general and project DoD item, record evidence or a finding.
11. For every Critical or High finding, run verify → fix → re-verify and log each loop; triage Medium and Low as fixed, accepted with a reason, or open item.
12. Confirm every decision record has a resolution or is marked pending review.
13. State at the top of the report that it is a self-check, not an independent review.
