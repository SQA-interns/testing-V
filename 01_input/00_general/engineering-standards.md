Apply to every component of every project.

| ID | Standard |
|---|---|
| ES-01 | Every value that differs between environments comes from configuration; secrets have no default in code. |
| ES-02 | Secrets are never committed; `.env` is ignored by git; `project/00_setup/secrets.env.example` lists every key. |
| ES-03 | The repository has `.gitattributes` normalising text files to LF and `.gitignore` excluding build output, dependencies and local config. |
| ES-04 | Dependency versions are exact and lock files are committed. |
| ES-05 | Each component offers one command each to build, test, check (format, lint, type check) and run; its README lists them. |
| ES-06 | Root README: purpose, components, quick start, documentation map. Component README: prerequisites, configuration (settings and secrets, with source), build, run, test, troubleshooting. |
| ES-07 | Logs contain no secrets or personal data; errors shown to users contain no internal details. |
| ES-08 | Persistent data structures are versioned (migrations or equivalent). |
| ES-09 | Deployable services expose health and readiness information. |
| ES-10 | Changes are limited to the task; do not refactor unrelated code. |
