# Severity scale

> Owner: QA lead · Read in: phases 0, 6, 7 · Agent: read-only

The only levels used anywhere. Critical and High block release.

| Level | Definition | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | Exploitable now, or total loss of a core user story with no workaround | Unauthenticated access to protected data; accepted input that is silently not stored |
| High | Exploitable under realistic conditions, or a core user story degraded for a plausible group of users | Missing authorization check on one operation; a limit that locks out legitimate users |
| Medium | A real defect with limited impact, or a control weaker than required | A dependency vulnerability with no reachable exploit path; a duplicated validation rule |
| Low | Cosmetic, stylistic, or a theoretical or false-positive finding | A lint warning; a scanner match on constant input |

## Rules

- Tools that report Critical/High/Medium/Low (or CVSS) are used as reported.
- Lowering a Critical or High to Medium or Low needs written evidence (e.g. the vulnerable feature is not used) and is a blocking decision.
- A surviving mutant in security-, validation- or persistence-related code is classified individually.

## Tool mapping

Extend when a project adds a tool with its own scale.

| Tool type | Tool's level | Maps to |
|---|---|---|
| CVSS-based (dependency scanners) | 9.0–10.0 / 7.0–8.9 / 4.0–6.9 / 0.1–3.9 | Critical / High / Medium / Low |
| Rule-based SAST with ERROR/WARNING/INFO | ERROR / WARNING / INFO | High / Medium / Low |
| Rank or priority 1–5 scales | 1 / 2 / 3–5 | High / Medium / Low |
| Bug-rank 1–20 scales | 1–4 / 5–9 / 10–20 | High / Medium / Low |
