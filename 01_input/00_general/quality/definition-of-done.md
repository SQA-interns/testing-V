Applies to every project; project additions are `DoD-Pnn` in `project/02_design/quality-requirements.md`.
Each item needs evidence in `docs/06_verification-report.md`.

| ID | Criterion | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| DoD-01 | The full test suite passes; frozen test hashes match the manifest | test report, hash check |
| DoD-02 | Format, lint, type check and static analysis report no errors | tool output |
| DoD-03 | Coverage and mutation score are recorded and meet the project thresholds, if any | coverage and mutation reports |
| DoD-04 | Architecture constraints (`AR`) are checked automatically where possible; no dependency cycles | architecture test output |
| DoD-05 | No open Critical or High finding from the security review and scanners | `general/skills/verify-release` output |
| DoD-06 | Every component runs in its target environment and the core user flows work at runtime, not only in tests | runtime demonstration log |
| DoD-07 | Every AC traces to at least one test and one commit | traceability table |
| DoD-08 | Root and component READMEs (ES-06) work when followed from a clean checkout | clone log |
| DoD-09 | Release notes list everything a human must test manually | `docs/release-notes.md` |
| DoD-10 | Every decision has a resolution or is listed as pending review; inputs and protected files are unchanged | decisions log, `docs/00_input-manifest.sha256` check |
| DoD-11 | The evidence checks in `general/phases.md` hold | `general/phases.md`, "Evidence" |
